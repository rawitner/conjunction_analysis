Massive Derelict Satellite Conjunction Analysis
================

This repo is part of a larger project Iâ€™m contributing to to monitor and
characterise the risk posed by massive, non-operational satellites in
Low Earth Orbit (LEO). See [here](misc_files/IAC%202017%20Adelaide.pdf)
and [here](misc_files/IAC%202018%20Germany.pdf) for background.

Part of my work involved determining the [need for a new
cluster](misc_files/derelict%20debris%20generating%20risk%20paper.pdf).
This work determines the worst offenders according to two different
algorithms.

Files in this repo:

  - `RDSfiles`: various R data files. They are saved in this format to
    make reading and writing files faster.
    - `all_conjs`: all conjunctions from 20OCT2019 onwards
    - `all_conjs_2916`: all conjunctions from 31MAR2016 onwards
    - `mcma_objs`: list of objects being monitored, including object specific information (name, country, launch date, altitude, etc.)
    - `derelictDatNew`: list of all massive, non-operational objects, including those not being monitored for conjunction activity
  - `conj_data`: daily files that report information any time two
    derelicts approached each other within 5 km. The files start at
    20OCT2019, which is when the new clusters were entered into the
    external program that generates these files.
  - `csvData_including_old`: raw conjunction data from 31MAR2016 until 11MAY2020
  - `docs`: HTML files used to render [results
    page](https://rawitner.github.io/conjunction_analysis/)
  - `daily_updates.R`: code to download eacha day's email attachment of the newest conjunction data.
